            <p>
                I love programming, I love art, and I love video games. It's my dream to enter a career that combines all three of these
                interests, whether that be within the video game industry or in a related industry such as film or animation. I belive
                that a career in game development is the best way to combine my interests in computer science and digital art, but while I
                do hope to get a job that is based in programming, I'd also be interested in exploring other jobs related to game development,
                including design, music & sound production, writing, and more. I am also open to exploring careers in neighboring fields such as 
                3D animation, tech art, and film VFX, as well as more techincal fields like software engineering and web development.
                <br> <br>
                Here at RIT, I hope to learn more about computer science, digital art & animation, and the overlap between them. I hope to deepen my
                programming skills and learn as many languages as I can. I hope to become familiar with industry-standard creative softwares such as
                Unity, Unreal Engine, Maya, and the Adobe Suite. I hope to understand what a career in these fields will actually be like, the nitty-
                gritty day to day. I hoep to make connections, gain professional experience, create amazing projects, and overall learn as much as I 
                can. In this class, I hope to gain proficiency in three new languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and to learn as much as I can about
                the mysteries of the Internet.
