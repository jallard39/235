        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The seventh installment of the Final Fantasy series takes place in a post-modern, steampunk, sci-fi world where 
            high technology reigns and where robots and bio-engineered mutants co-exist with humans and dragons. The story 
            focuses on Shinra Inc., an evil mega-corporation responsible for all the world's high technology. [...] The main 
            character is an ex-Shinra soldier named Cloud Strife, an angst-ridden fellow with a complex history that is explained 
            as the game goes on. [U]ltimately, Cloud must not only fight against Shinra but also stop a powerful man from his past 
            from destroying the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like its predecessors, Final Fantasy VII is a role-playing game in Japanese style, featuring turn-based combat with 
            a real-time (ATB, "active time battle") element against randomly appearing enemies. [...] The game utilizes 3D character 
            models and pre-rendered backgrounds with varying camera angles for the exploration of towns and hostile areas. World map 
            navigation and battle screens are done completely in 3D. CG movies are frequently used as cutscenes that advance the game's story.

        <blockquote>"Before its release, many companies were hesitant on bringing some Japanese role-playing 
            games over because they feared there wasn't a big enough market for them. That all changed after 
            Square's masterpiece was released."</blockquote>
