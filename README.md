# 235

This a collection of all exercises and projects I created in the Introduction to Web Technology for Game Developers (IGME 235) at RIT. This code showcases a variety of programming and web development concepts and demonstrates my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

[This course ran from August 2022 through December 2022. All code in this repo was created during this time. Repository is archived.]
